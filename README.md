## About MAWILab
MAWILab is a database that assists researchers to evaluate their traffic anomaly detection methods. It consists of a set of labels locating traffic anomalies in the MAWI archive (samplepoints B and F). The labels are obtained using an advanced graph-based methodology that compares and combines different and independent anomaly detectors. The data set is daily updated to include new traffic from upcoming applications and anomalies.
